# Heart attack analysis 
The following  project is used to analyse the heart attack dataset using python scikit-learn. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN,Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc .
# Data's demographic:
• Sex: male(1) or female(0) 

• Age: Age of the patient

• Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker 

• Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.

Medical( history)

• BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication 

• Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke

• Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive 

• Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes 

Medical(current)

• Tot Chol: total cholesterol level 

• Sys BP: systolic blood pressure 

• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure 

• BMI: Body Mass Index 

• Heart Rate: heart rate 

• Glucose: glucose level 

• 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD (binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)

algorithms used:
1. logistic regresion(Scikit-learn)
2. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. Random Forest(Scikit-learn)
